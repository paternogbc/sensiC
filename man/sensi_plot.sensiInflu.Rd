\method{sensi_plot}{sensiInflu}(x, graphs = "all", param = "slope", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{output from \code{influ_phylm}}

\item{graphs}{choose which graph should be printed on the output ("all", 1,2,3 or 4)}

\description{
\code{plot_influ_phylm} Plot results from \code{influ_phylm} and
\code{influ_phyglm}
}
\details{
For 'x' from influ_phylm or influ_phyglm:

Graph 1: Distribution of estimated slopes or intercepts for each
simulation (leave-one-out deletion). Red vertical line represents the original
slope or intercept from the full model (with all species).

Graph 2: Original regression plot (\eqn{trait~predictor}). Standardized
difference in slope or intercept is represented by a continous size scale.

Graph 3: Distribution of Standardized difference in slope or intercept. Red
colour indicates inbfluential species (with a standardised difference above
the value of \code{cutoff}).

Graph 4: Ditribution of the percentage of change in slope or intercept.
